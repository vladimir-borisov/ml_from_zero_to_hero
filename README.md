# Description 

Machine learning algorithms from scratch implemented with Python. 

Main goal of this project is to implement machine learning algorithms from zero in the most simple way without 
hard optimization tricks.

All the implementations of classical ML algorithms are trying to be close to scikit-learn logic (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) in terms of 
input/output variables and function names.
